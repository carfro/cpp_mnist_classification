# MNIST Image Recognition in C++

This project implements basic machine learning algorithms for image recognition on the MNIST dataset in C++. 
**Currently, it almosts includes a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier.**
The code is structured for modularity, utilizing smart pointers and OpenMP for parallel processing to handle the dataset efficiently.
 It includes methods for data handling, normalization, and basic classification using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).

### Key Files

- **Makefile**: Automates compilation and linking, generating both the executable and shared library.
- **data_handler.hpp / data_handler.cc**: Manages image and label data, including reading, normalizing, and splitting the dataset into training, test, and validation sets.
- **data.hpp / data.cc**: Defines the `data` class, handling individual data points’ feature vectors, labels, and normalization.

## Prerequisites

- **Compiler**: Requires `g++` with C++17 or later support.
- **OpenMP**: For parallel processing.
- **MNIST Dataset**: Download the MNIST dataset and place the files in the `data/` directory (linked above).

## Build and Run

1. **Compile**: Run `make all` to build the executable and shared library.

    ```sh
    make all
    ```

2. **Run the Program**: Execute the generated binary.

    ```sh
    ./bin/main.exe
    ```

3. **Clean**: To remove generated files, use `make clean`.

    ```sh
    make clean
    ```

## Code Overview

- **data Class (`data.hpp`, `data.cc`)**: Manages individual data points, handling feature vectors, labels, and normalization. Uses smart pointers for memory management.
  
- **data_handler Class (`data_handler.hpp`, `data_handler.cc`)**: Manages the dataset, including reading, normalizing, splitting, and counting classes, with multi-threading support via OpenMP.

## Future Work

This implementation lays the groundwork for testing and refining additional machine learning algorithms on the MNIST dataset.
